### Quarkus [kubernetes-quickstart](./kubernetes-quickstart)

Code based on [Quarkus - Kubernetes extension](https://quarkus.io/guides/deploying-to-kubernetes) guide.  
It has been created to test the addition of existing resources into the created `minikube.json` file to understand if Quarkus 1.10.5 was affected by an issue.  
More in the project's [README](./kubernetes-quickstart/README.md).
